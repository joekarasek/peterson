\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \strokec2 Dental implants are a great option for replacing missing teeth, improving chewing ability, eliminating bridges, and replacing dentures.\
\
Several implants may provide a base for a series of artificial teeth known as a fixed bridge. Implants can even be used to secure a full set of removable dentures for people who have no remaining natural teeth.\

\f0\b \cf2 \strokec2 Same Day Crowns\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \strokec2 CEREC\'ae technology allows our practice to create tooth-colored porcelain restorations for healthy, beautiful smiles in a single appointment.\
\
Crowns should be placed before the tooth is so decayed that it may fracture. This can often help prevent the expense of root canal therapy in the future. If a tooth is too damaged to have a crown applied, a porcelain bridge may be a good alternative.\

\f0\b \cf2 \strokec2 Smile-Whitening\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \strokec2 Many everyday things like coffee, tea and wine can significantly dull teeth. Smile-whitening enables us to significantly brighten your smile for that dazzling white smile you deserve.\
\
Plastic whitening trays will be made from models of your teeth. You will then place a special whitening gel in each tray and wear the trays in your mouth for several hours per day. (Many patients wear their trays after dinner and before bed.) A significant change in tooth color is usually seen in just four to six weeks.\

\f0\b \cf2 \strokec2 Sleep Apnea Treatment\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \strokec2 Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the airway completely collapses, blocking airflow into the lungs. The harder one tries to breathe, the tighter the airway seals. This airway obstruction persists until the brain partially awakens the person, unconsciously closing the jaw and returning the tongue and throat to a normal position.\
\
We offer effective, nonsurgical relief from sleep apnea and other sleep-related disorders\'97including snoring. Ask us how you can get the restful, healthy sleep you\'92ve been missing.}
